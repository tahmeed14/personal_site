Currently Under Construction...


- [[Jan 2017 - Sep 2017]()] I was a member of the Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab (SRLL) at the University of Michigan. I worked with then second year PhD student, [Hyesun Yoo](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yoohs/), and was supervised by [Dr. Susan A. Murphy](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16868661/index.html) of the Department of Statistics. Since then, SRLL has moved to a different institution but SRLL collaborates with my current research lab.


- [[June 2017 - July 2017]()] I was a member of the Big Data Summer Institute at the University of Michigan where I worked very closely with [Dr. Phil Boonstra](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~philb/), Dr. Matt Zawistowski and [Dr. Zhenke Wu](http://zhenkewu.com/) from the Department of Biostatistics. My team comprised of two other students: Deesha Bhaumik from Johns Hopkins University and Christian Erickson from Hope College.


- [[May 2016 - August 2016]()] During the summer between my sophomore and junior year, I worked with Robert F. Schoeni from the Institute for Social Research. More to come..
