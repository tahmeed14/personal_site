title: "The People"
---

It's pretty important to have influential people in our lives. Like a lot of people, I've had mentors who have inspired me, motivated me, or have pushed me to continue pursuing my interest in data science.


All of these people owed me nothing and has helped me without expecting nothing in return.


I dedicate this page to them


- Mom & Dad
- Dr. Bob Schoeni
- Dr. Susan Murphy
- Hyesun Yoo
- Dr. Naisyin Wang


Also shoutouts to my friends who reproach me for doing so much school, you know who you are...
