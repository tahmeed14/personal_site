title: "The People"
---

It's pretty important to have influential people in our lives. Much like others, I've had many people in my life who have in the past or still inspire and motivate me in my pursuit of statistics and data science as my passion. 


I dedicate this page to them


- Mom & Dad
- Robert Schoeni
- Susan Murphy
- Hyesun Yoo
- Naisyin Wang
- Phil Boonstra
- Bhramar Mukherjee


Also shoutouts to my friends who reproach me for doing so much school, you know who you are...
