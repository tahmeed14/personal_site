title: "The People"
---

It's pretty important to have influential people in our lives. Like a lot of people, I've had mentors who have inspired me, motivated me, or have pushed me to continue pursuing my interest in data science.


All of these people owed me nothing and have helped me without expecting nothing in return.


I dedicate this page to them


- Mom & Dad
- Dr. Bob Schoeni
- Dr. Susan Murphy
- Hyesun Yoo
- Dr. Naisyin Wang
- Dr. Inbal Nahum-Shani
- Jamie Yap


Also huge shoutout to my friends
