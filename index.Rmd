<h3><b>About Me</b></h3>

I am currently a Data Scientist at [KPMG US](https://www.kpmg.us/) where I work in the Data & Analytics branch with the [Signals Team](https://advisory-marketing.us.kpmg.com/speed/ai-signals.html).\newline 

Although my job title is "Data Scientist", I was formally trained as a Statistician and I enjoy approaching problems from a "statistician's perspective". Outside of my professional life, I love to apply my knowledge of statistics to soccer (football) analytics and also dive deep into learning more about the tactical aspects of the sport.\newline 

My dad and cousin introduced me to soccer through the [2002 World Cup](https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/2002korea-japan) and I have followed it ever since. I have supported [Chelsea F.C.](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) since I was a seven year old and have supported the [University of Michigan](https://mgoblue.com/) sports teams particularly [football](https://mgoblue.com/sports/football) since my family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan.
