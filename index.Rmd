## Previously...

- [[Jan 2017 - Sep 2017]()] I was a member of the Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab (SRLL) at the University of Michigan. I worked with then second year PhD student, [Hyesun Yoo](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yoohs/), and was supervised by [Dr. Susan A. Murphy](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16868661/index.html) of the Department of Statistics. Since then, SRLL has moved to a different institution but SRLL collaborates with my current research lab.

My team comprised of two other students: Deesha Bhaumik from Johns Hopkins University and Christian Erickson from Hope College.


- [[May 2016 - August 2016]()] During the summer between my sophomore and junior year, I worked with Robert F. Schoeni from the Institute for Social Research. More to come..
